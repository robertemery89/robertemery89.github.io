          <p >My name is Robert Emery and I like the woods. I made this site in order to share my love of the woods with others. I hope that you are able to use my experiences to help plan your own. Those who are here to just read and enjoy my adventures are just as welcome.
          The entire site has been an udertaking of my own. All of the hikes are hikes that I have done, in fact this sight is an attempt to document all the hikes I can remember doing. Pictures are mostly taken by me, any others have been taken by hiking companions. The entire site has been hard coded by me and I hope to continue to improve it as my skills get better. Please check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-e-emery/">LinkedIn page</a> if you are interested in becoming professionally aquainted. 
          <p>I hope you enjoy the site and get out there to explore the woods!</p>
