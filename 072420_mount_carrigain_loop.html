                <h3>Two nights of camping at the base of Mount Carrigain brought me to remote woods, alpine lakes, gorgeous cascades, and a monumental view.</h3>

                    <img class="two-align-one-vert" src="resources/media/072420_mount_carrigain_loop/IMG_20200724_083210.jpg">

                <p>I was so excited to embark upon this solo hike and I was not disappointed. Like a kid on Christmas morning I got up at 5AM in order to get on the trail by 8AM. I started at the Signal Ridge Trailhead and got off and running. The trail began on a very easy grade interspersed with some puncheons, I do love me a good set of puncheon. The trail followed Whiteface and the Carrigain Brooke and I was able to make quick work of the first three plus miles. Amid this I turned right onto Carrigain Notch Trail.</p>
                <p>I took my first break after the trail met with Carrigain Brook and offered a look at Mt Simon. I was able to creatively make my way through some brush to a fallen tree where I enjoyed the quiet stream and my snack. In retrospect I would have enjoyed a better break right before Carrigain Notch where a more open view could have been enjoyed. I was surprised at how quickly I was able to make it to the highest point of my day’s hike. </p>
                <div class="image-row">

                </div>
                <p>The next portion of my hike was by far the buggiest of the entire three days but did offer a very wild feel through some wetlands. The trail itself was fairly dry for me as not much rain preceded my hike. At one point I was very lucky to catch a glimpse of what I believe was a gray fox. It must have seen me before I saw it so I only caught the back of it as it pounced through the undergrowth away from me. Whatever I saw, I loved the remoteness the trail offered.</p>

                </div>
                <p>When I reached the intersection with Nancy Pond Trail I took a very quick detour to enjoy the serenity of Notch Brook. Check out the video, below, and this <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/USTB6TkGUR4CqwhU8" target="_blank">photosphere</a> for a quick preview of it. In addition to its beauty, the moving water (and my freshly applied bug spray) kept the bugs away and I was able to relax on one of the rocks resting in the middle of the brook. There were many opportunities to stop and enjoy how remote this hike felt and I couldn’t have enjoyed the first one more. Although I didn’t want to leave, I took solace in the fact that I would be crossing this stream twice more on the following day.</p>
                <div class="image-row">

                </div>
                <p>The rest of the day’s hike was through a virtually straight and flat section of Carrigain Notch trail and I was able to reach the location of my campsite, the intersection of Desolation Trail, before noon. There was a big site immediately at the intersection, but many more preferred sites offered more privacy and proximity to Carrigain Branch. I ended up taking a spacious site right before a brook flows into Carrigain Branch. I crossed the brook to reach it. </p>

                </div>
                <p>While I was still warm from my hike I wanted to take a dip in the cool mountain water. Before setting up my site I left my pack and walked down the brook to find a place to rinse off. As I walked downstream, it got more and more pretty as the rocks turned into big granite slabs for the water to run over. It also offered a couple views of Mount Carrigain looming over me. There were a few different places where I was able to submerge myself and I felt so much more fresh after doing so. Then I returned to my site and set up my tent and hammock on opposite sides of the brook and spent the rest of the day hanging out in my hammock and listening to the running water. It was a beautiful place to spend two nights.</p>

                <p>I woke up on Saturday excited to explore without my big pack and with my lightweight barefoot running shoes. I was on the trail by 8AM and heading back the way I came on Carrigain Notch Trail. I quickly covered the three quarters of a mile to Nancy Pond Trail followed by a flat stretch through four easy water crossings and a cool stretch through some short hemlocks which felt like nature’s tunnel. After the last crossing, the trail began gaining elevation, but at a very gradual rate in which I was able to make quick progress. </p>

                    <img class="two-align-one-vert" id="horizontal-two"src="resources/media/072420_mount_carrigain_loop/IMG_20200725_085226.jpg">

                <p>Again, I felt like I had the woods to myself and it was obvious I was the first to make my way through the trail by the dozens upon dozens of spider webs I took down. This uphill section was uneventful except for a variety of mushrooms and a few toads hopping their way across the trail. Then after 3.4 miles covered and 800 feet gained in elevation in about 75 minutes I reached the amazing alpine Norcross Pond.</p>
                <div class="image-row">

                </div>
                <p>This was a spectacular place to take a rest as the pond was on one side and a gorgeous view of the Bonds lied on the other. When I resumed, I enjoyed a much more leisurely pace through the continuous beautiful scenery. Initially I tried following the advice of my AMC White Mountain Guide by following a trail on the right side of the pond along the shore. I must have made a mistake because there were many rocks directly on the shore that I thought was the path. I hopped from rock to rock until I realized that this was merely just the shore and no real path or dry land existed. I took great care to step only on rocks and dead wood in order to preserve the alpine vegetation and the dryness of my feet. Since it was still early I was able to enjoy this remote pond all to myself. The lily pads, dragonflies, frogs and Mount Nancy provided great company. I spotted what I thought to be moose tracks and saw two beaver dens, but was not graced by any large mammal sightings. This photosphere gives a sense of how great a place this pond really was.</p>
                <p>After almost an hour I made it to the other side of the pond and passed by Upper Norcross Pond which I could only enjoy from a safe distance, as no solid footing exists along the shore. I then crossed the boundary from the Pemigewasset Wilderness into the The Nancy Brook Research Natural Area which my AMC guide describes as <q>the almost imperceptible height of land.</q> Much of the trail is on top of puncheon and it didn’t take long to arrive at Nancy Pond. I was still on high alert to hopefully see some beaver or moose, but was at least able to watch some ducks swim across the pond.</p>
                <div class="image-row">
                    <img class="two-align"  src="resources/media/072420_mount_carrigain_loop/IMG_20200725_113128.jpg">

                </div>
                <p>The trail got quite steep as I descended through the rooty trail in old growth forest as I approached upper Nancy Falls. I was able to veer off trail to a spot between two small sections of the falls to take in a lovely east facing vista. As I descended there were a few more opportunities to view sections of the falls, but by far the best was at the bottom at the lower falls. I was joined by many other hikers who rested in a large clearing at the foot of the falls right in front of a small pool. It was just after 1PM, 5 hours into my hike, by the time I made it to this point.</p>

                <p>I then made my way back up the steep trail parallel to the falls and took another short rest to take in a small peaceful part of Nancy Brook just above the falls. I returned past Nancy Pond and the multiple campsites near its shores. There were also a few sites at the far end of Norcross Pond. I stopped one more time at the end of Norcross Pond to take in my last open vista of the day. I made quick work of the descent due to my light pack, running shoes, and very forgiving grade to make it back to my site followed by a quick swim and much needed relaxing in my hammock. I fell in love with my sight during my two nights there and wish to return to the brook some day (a partial photosphere to give you a sense). For anyone planning on camping in the area, I recommend going further down the trail (probably about ¼ or ⅓ of a mile from the intersection) to a large site that immediately looks at big granite slabs in the brook and offers swimming right there.</p>
                <p>On Sunday morning I woke up, packed up my site, and was anxious about carrying my backpack up twenty-five hundred feet to the peak of Mount Carrigain. Since this elevation was covered in less than two miles I took a decidedly measured pace up the mountain. About halfway up I started to catch glimpses of the basin from which I just hiked. The trail was consistently very steep, however the trail was manageable and did not require any scrambling. Don’t get me wrong, the trail is intimidating in its steepness at times, but at the right pace it can be done without too much trouble.</p>

                <p>I adopting the mindset that the climb would take the better part of the morning and was surprised when I reached the summit with virtually no warning. The wind was immediately apparent and I put on every layer I packed before climbing up the fire tower. Once atop, the view was absolutely stunning. Mount Carrigain is much higher than all the peaks in the immediate surrounding and I was able to see so many peaks throughout the White Mountains. Unfortunately the presidentials were hidden behind the clouds, but I was able to trace out many of the peaks along the Pemi Loop as well as all the peaks of the Sandwich Range. The most beautiful direction was probably looking down at Signal Ridge. This poor attempt at a panorama and this video only give a small sense of the beauty that awaits you atop this mountain.</p>

                </div>
                <p>After about a half hour resting, snacking, and enjoying the view I climbed down the tower and started the lengthy descent to my car. I passed a designated campsite at the summit and passed many hikers as they approached the summit. Signal Ridge continued to offer many views of the surroundings and the peak of Carrigain. When I reached the last viewpoint, I had difficulty leaving it behind to descend back into the woods.</p>

                <p>The next hour and a half required a slower pace down steeper terrain. Then the evergreen forest gave way to lowland hardwoods as it became a more forgiving descent. Right as this transitioning was occurring I crossed a tiny stream over a short bridge and took a seat for my last break and snack of the hike. Shortly after I reached the intersection with Carrigain Notch Trail and powered my through the last two miles back to my car. I ended up reaching my car at 1:15 PM and finished another amazing wilderness experience.</p>
