                <p>After parking at the trailhead, the road continues, but no parking is allowed.I followed this road and after a short while it turns into a trail. In terms of navigating, just continue straight ahead.</p>
                <p>Since I visited in late June, the woods were green as could be. The trail was wide and I suspect it is an old logging road or railway. I was able to easily walk side by side for most of the first mile. After about fifteen minutes of hiking I heard the sound of a brook through the woods. Quickly after that the trail converged on Coppermine Brook. It hold the beauty of many streams and brooks of the White Mountains with smooth granite and clear water. I enjoyed taking a quick detail off the trail to walk along the water. Although I could have walked along the water longer, I returned to the trail in order to reach the destination more quickly.
                </p>
                <p>Along the two and a half miles the trail stays near the brook, occasionally running adjacent to it and crossing. Other than beautiful green tree cover and undergrowth, the trail was uneventful until I reached the Coppermine Shelter. The shelter has a fire ring and is held up by various piles of rocks, but looked sturdy enough. If I were to camp here I would prefer to set up my tent (there’s space for no more than four people) at a flat clearing shortly up the trail.</p>
                <div class="image-row">
                    <img class="two-align" src="resources/media/070120_bridal_veil_falls/IMG_20200702_112441.jpg">

                <p>Immediately after this tentsite I was greeted by the falls. A calm pool lies at the bottom of a long smooth sheet of inclined granite. I witnessed a couple sliding down the rock, but it was a too uneven for my taste. They claimed to make the ~30 foot slide without discomfort. I made the slippery climb on the drier part fo the smooth granite to a small landing with a view of the upper falls. This was a nice place to enjoy the first course of my lunch. I was antsy to climb to the upper fall where I hoped another, more private swimming hole existed. I climbed to the left of the falls. It was somewhat challenging and all my limbs were required to make it up the the top. And yes, there was a clear water sitting gently below the crashing Bridal Veil Falls. After quickly changing into my swim trunks I dipped my feet in the water and was surprised by the chill of the water. I was able to meneuver throught the stones and take the full body plunge. It is not deep enough to jump from any height, but I was able to manage a sort of dive which was more refreshing after hiking uphill for two miles in the warm humidity. Although the water felt spectacular I did not stay in long. I dried off, laid out my towel, and propped my head on my sitting pad and enjoyed the summer sun in the mountain air with the subtle mist of the nearby falls. I wondered why I ever go to the beach when such serenity lies in the woods.</p>
                <p>I was lucky enough to have journeyed here on a day with only four friendly strangers joining us at the top of the falls. The space easily accommodate us, and maybe could have fit a couple more.</p>
                <p>After about two hours enjoying the falls it was time to head back. The return hike passed quickly with the help of the fall’s refreshment, gentle slope and calming brook noises.</p>
