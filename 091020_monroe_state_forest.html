                <h3>The small old growth forest around the Cascades on Dunbar Brook is the real attraction. The gigantic trees, lush forest, and serene brook made this area feel beyond Massachusetts.</h3>

                <div class="image-row">

                <p>I arrived at this hike after driving through the beautiful remote roads of Western Massachusetts and following the dramatic Deerfield River. After leaving my car I encountered an arrangement of sticks that spelled “FOLLOW THE ARROWS” with an arrow pointing up a dirt road toward some power lines. Rain had just stopped, the air was heavy, no other cars were in the parking lot, and I was beginning to feel like I was in a Stephen King novel. Nevertheless I began my journey into these old woods as another arrow pointed into the dense woods and what appeared to be Dunbar Brook Trail.</p>
                <div class="image-row">
                    <img class="two-align"  src="resources/media/091020_monroe_state_forest/IMG_20200910_154947.jpg">

                </div>
                <p>The forest was lush and the flat trail followed Dunbar Brook upstream. Moss, ferns and hobblebush lined the trail and I reached a new bridge crossing Dunbar Brook after a half hour. I took note of Smith Hollow Trail to the left, where I would come from tomorrow, and crossed the bridge.</p>
                <div class="image-row">  
                    <img class="two-align-one-vert" id="horizontal-two"src="resources/media/091020_monroe_state_forest/IMG_20200910_160453.jpg">

                </div>
                <p>I quickly noted the size of some trees that were exceptionally large as part of this small patch of old growth forest. A white pine on the left of the trail is especially striking as it dwarfs the surrounding trees in both diameter and height. I quickly came upon Haley Brook, rock hopped across and found Dunbar Brook Shelter. The shelter looks regularly used but I was the only inhabitant this damp evening.</p>
                <div class="image-row">  
                    <img class="two-align-one-vert" src="resources/media/091020_monroe_state_forest/IMG_20200910_161133.jpg">

                </div>
                <p>After setting up my camp and hanging my food I followed a spur about a quarter mile down to the Cascades on Dunbar Brook. The forest opened up around huge boulders and a big pool below the most prominent cascade. The small falls were nothing spectacular but the gestalt of this little place gave me peace. I quickly stripped down and plunged into the inviting pool and was surprised at the depth of the water which reached over six feet.</p>
                <div class="image-row">

                </div>
                <p>I explored Dunbar Brook Trail a little beyond the powerline corridor in search of my favorite place in the woods, a tree fallen over the brook to sit upon. The trail stubbornly remained up above the stream until I detoured to descend steep and soft soil to reach the brook about twenty feet below. I found my log, and melodramatically watched individual leaves slowly drop to the surface as I contemplated the soon arriving autumn season.</p>

                <p>I awoke hours before sunrise after being unable to sleep and hung out in my hammock reading by headlamp anticipating daytime. Once bright enough, I carried my stove down to the cascades and enjoyed a hot oatmeal breakfast with cashew butter while listening to the babbling brook.</p>
                <div class="image-row">

                <p>I embarked upon my circuit of Monroe State Forest by  heading northwest on Dunbar Brook Trail. I noticed lots of old birch trees and many more giant pines. In retrospect I wish I would have explored more off trail to find bigger trees. I did find the best fallen tree over the brook that was stripped of its bark and the resulting smooth surface was a lovely place to sit and have a morning stretch.</p>

                <p>A noteworthy theme of the day was the bug situation. I did not encounter any mosquitos during my hike and was just barely bothered by a few horseflies. However the incredible amount of spider webs hindered the enjoyment of this hike. I am accustomed to clearing out spiderwebs as the first hiker on backcountry trails, but today was exceptional in this regard. After walking through dozens of webs I focused too much attention on using a stick to clear out the mostly invisible webs before me.</p>
                <div class="image-row">
                    <img class="two-align"  src="resources/media/091020_monroe_state_forest/IMG_20200910_170825.jpg">

                <p>When I reached the unpaved Raycroft Road, I filled my water bladder since I wouldn’t see running water for the next six miles. I followed the road south for a quarter mile before Spruce Hill Trail began. The climb to Spruce Mountain is by far the most challenging portion of the hike as it climbed a thousand feet over the three miles from Raycroft Road, but was far from strenuous. There were a couple times the path was unclear but not enough to lead me astray.</p>
                <div class="image-row">
                    <img class="big-image" src="resources/media/091020_monroe_state_forest/IMG_20200911_110328.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>When I reached the summit a small clearing provided a southward view of the beautiful hills including a ski mountain I assume to be Berkshire East. I hoped to have a place to sit and look out, but the view was best seen by standing and obscured otherwise. I continued in hopes of finding another lookout that was marked on a map at the base of the mountain, but I tragically left wanting. I decided to descend in hopes that Raycroft Outlook would offer better scenery.</p>
                <div class="image-row">

                </div>
                <p>After forty minutes of running/hiking I reached Raycroft Road. I followed a sign for Raycroft Outlook down a dirt road becoming a hiking path a half mile to the old outlook. It is a stone platform that is old and a bit rundown but did provide a nice view from a similar height to the surrounding hills. Some rocks served as a nice place to sit, enjoy lunch, and enjoy the beautiful late summer day.</p>
                <div class="image-row">

                <p>By this point I had not spent as much time at any of the sights as I had hoped and decided that the pace of my trip did not require the second night I planned on staying. The thought of a hot sandwich, warm shower, and soft bed combined with my dreadful night of sleep was enough to cut my trip a night short. After returning up the lookout trail I turned right onto Raycroft Road instead of Smith Hollow Trail which ran parallel. I joined Smith Hollow Trail when it turned into the woods. It became quite steep as it descended into the Dunbar Brook valley.</p>

                <p>I followed Dunbar Brook Trail back to my shelter and packed up camp. I couldn’t pass up one more chance to plunge into the pool at the Cascades on Dunbar Brook and rid myself of the layers of spider webs. From here I returned to the trailhead the way I came on Thursday with the Number 9 sub from D’angelo’s on my mind.</p>
